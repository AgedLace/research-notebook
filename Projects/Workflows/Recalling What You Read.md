# Recalling What You Read

While reading look for ...
- sections that resonate with you
- try to only highlight a single sentence at a time
- sentences that you think will still have meaning in the future
- quantity = one highlight every few pages

Post-Processing
- Create new note in Obsidian
-  Import book and notes to Obsidian
	- Title of Note = [[Publish Year]] - [[Book Title]]
- Store in `Sources/Books`

Processing Highlights
- Process as soon as possible after reading
- Notate your highlights
	- re-read each highlight
	- mark important passages as either **bold** or *italic*
		- **bold** reserved for short phrases
		- *italics* for longer pieces
- Summarize the book in your own words
	- Put your summary at the top of the Note
	- Summarize the main points *in your own words*
	- Use bullets
	- Keep summary to 3-5 bullet points
	- Link to key concepts in your other notes

Recall
- Periodically review your notes
- Your links will also enable you to recall the book's material
