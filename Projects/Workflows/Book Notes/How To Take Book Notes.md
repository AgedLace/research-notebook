# How To Take Book Notes

- Keep a list of books by year
- Only headings are "Months"
	- **April**
		- Title One
		- Title Two
		- Title Three
-  Don't Repeat Yourself [DRY]
	- create reusable notes that do not need to be written again
	- large notes = single purpose notes
	- atomic notes = useful for thousands of things
