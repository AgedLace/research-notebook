# Lesson 02 - Blink

## Overview

- program the UNO R3 controller board to blink the built-in LED
- learn how to download programs by basic steps

## Required Component

- Elegoo UNO R3


## Principle

- A single on-board LED which can be controlled from sketches
- Often referred to as the 'L' LED
- It may already blink when plugged into a USB plug
	- If so, the board has shipped with the "Blink" sketch pre-installed.

Blink is the physical translation of the well known "hello world" program

## Task

- reprogram the board without our own Blink sketch
	- Load the 'example' sketch
		- File > Examples > 01.Basics 
- change the rate at which it blinks




#### Process

- Connect UNO R3 to PC via USB
- 'Burn' your first program on the board
	- File > Sketchbook > Arduino-1.8.5 > Examples > Digital > BlinK
- Check the Serial Monitor (terminal window)
	- Tools > Serial Port > Select the Serial Port
