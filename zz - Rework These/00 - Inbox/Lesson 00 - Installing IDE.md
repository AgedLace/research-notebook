# Lesson 00 - Installing IDE

IDE = Integrated Development Environment   
- IDE is the software side of the Arduino platform

This lesson steps through installing this IDE on the local computer.

	- 0.5 KB used for boot loader
- SRAM > 2 KB
- EEPROM > 1 KB
	- can read and written with EEPROM library
- Clock Speed > 16MHz
- 14 digital input/output pins
	- 6 can be used as PWM outputs
	- 6 analog inputs
- a 16 MHz crystal oscillator
- USB connection
- power jack
- ICSP header
- reset button

UNO = 'one' in Italian
- named to mark upcoming releases, *i.e.*
	- Arduino 1.0 - The UNO and version (1, in this case)
	- Arduino 1.1 - future referenced version style

### Power Source
* can be powered via USB or external power supply
* power source selected automatically
* external power can be either ...
	* AC-to-DC adapter
		* can be connected by plugging a 2.1 mm center-positive plug in board's power jack.
	* can operated on 6 to 20V
		* if < 7V, the 5V pin may supply less than 5 V and board may not be stable
		* if > 12V, voltage regulator may overhead and damage board
		* **RECOMMENDED - 7 to 12V**
	* battery
		* battery leads can be inserted in the `GND` and `Vin` pin headers of the POWER connector.

### Power Pins

- `VIN` > input voltage when using external power source
	- NOTE - USB or other regulated power source is 5V
- `5V` > the regulated power supply
	- comes via `VIN`, or USB or other regulated 5V supply
- `3V3` > a 3.3V supply generated by on-board regulator
	- Max current draw is 50 mA
- `GND` > Ground pins

### 14 Digital Pins

- can be `input` or `output`; by using the following functions ...
	- pinMode()
	- digital Write()
	- digital Read()
- operate at 5V
- each pin can provide, or receive, 
	- max of 40 mA
	- has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50K Ohms

### Specialized Pins

- `Serial: 0(RX) and 1 (TX)`
	- used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data
	- are connected to corresponding pins of ATmega8U2 USB-to-TTL Serial chip
- `External Interrupts: 2 and 3`
	- can be configured to trigger an interruption on ...
		- a low value
		- a rising or falling edge
		- a change in value
- `PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11`
	- Provide 9-bit PWN output with analogWrite() function
- `SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK)`
	- support SPI communication not currenlty included in Arduino language
- `LED: 13`
	- built-in LED connected to digital pin 13
		- when pin is HIGH value, LED is on
		- when pin is LOW, it's off

### 6 Analog Inputs

- each provides 10 bits of resolution (1024 different values)
- By default, they measure from `GND` to 5V
	- possible to change the upper end of range using `AREF` pin and analog Reference () function

### Specialized Analog Inputs

- I<sup>2</sup>C: 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL)
	- support I<sup>2</sup>C (TWI) communications using the Wire library
- `AREF`
	- reference voltage for analog inputs
	- used with analogReference () function
- `Reset`
	- Bring this line LOW to reset microcontroller
	- typically used to add a reset button to shields which bloc the one on the board

### ATmega328

- provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication
	- available on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX)
- ATmega8U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on computer
- `8U2` firmware uses standard USB COM drivers; no external drivers needed

### Serial Monitor (serial port terminal)

- allows simple text data to be sent to/from the board
- RX and TX LEDS will flash when data is being TX via USB-to-serial chip and USB connection to computer
	- NOT for serial communication on pins 0 and 1
- supports I2C (TWI) and SPI communication
	- software includes the Wire library to simplify use of I2C bus

### Programming

- Select "Arduino Uno w/ATmega328" from **Tools > Board** menu
- comes pre-burned with boot loader
	- allows to upload new code w/o the use of an external hardware programmer
- communicates using original STK500 protocol
- can bypass boot load and program controller through the ICSP header
	- ICSP = In-Circuit Serial Programming
- ATmega8U2 firmware source code is available
	- is loaded w/ DFU boot loader
		- can be activated by connecting the solder jumper on back of bard (near map of Italy); then reset the 8U2
		- can then use DFU programmer to load new firmware
		- or use the ISP header with an external programmer (overwriting the DFU boot loader)
