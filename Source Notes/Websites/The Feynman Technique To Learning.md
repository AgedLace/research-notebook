## Who was Richard Feynman?

- an American theoretical physicist
	- what is a "theoretical physicist"?
		- one who uses math modules and abstractions to rationalize, explain and predict natural phenomena 
		- https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Theoretical_physicist
- received Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for contributions in developing quantum electrodynamics (QED)
	- what is QED?
		- https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quantum_electrodynamics
		- describes how light and matter interact
		- mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism
- named one of the 10 greatest physicists of all time
- author of several books

Concept:  If you can't explain something to someone who knows little to nothing about it, you don't understand it yourself.

## 4 Step Process

- Name it
- Explain it
	- use simple analogies
	- identify the gaps in your own understanding
- Review what you don't understand
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you can give a satisfactory explanation

## Finding gaps in your understanding

- When you resort to citing the textbook almost word for word because you can't explain the subject in your own words

## Ask yourself questions

- What does this mean?
- What could be an example of this?
