- Organize by Book
- Organize by Theme

## Process

### Placeholders

- Create a note for each book
- Create a note for any theme / topic currently interested in
- Create a note for memorization, sermon to write, essay to write, etc

### Start Reading

- Highlight important words / passages
- Write notes in the margins
- Or, take notes in obsidian directly

### Create Notes - Add Links

- As you read, create new notes; jot down your thoughts and ideas
- Add links to the note you made in previous step(s)
	- To me, this looks like the placeholders will become MOCs over time
- Link to other notes or ideas already made; create as many connections as you can
